[Eggs for Breakfast](http://kevino-is.me/eggs_for_breakfast/) takes the conventional dialogue system of games and breaks it down further in an attempt to reflect the awkwardness and anxieties of real, natural conversations.

TODO
- Better writing design
    -Actually finish writing the script
    "bad" inputs by the user
    - take matthewit's suggestion of making the game aware
    when you are inputing nonsensical things
	-come up with better inaction/flub dialogue
		- randomize responses? Could be better
- Callback functions for OnLoad and OnSpeak
- fix query algo
    - Actual NLP solution based on syntax analysis and weighted
    words (for example the subject should be "Tim" and is weighted
    with a value of 50).
- fuck these alerts write a better error logging system for the twine stuff
- Fix the text tweening. Seriously what's wrong with it lmfao
